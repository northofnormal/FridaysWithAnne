## __"Don't Get Fired"__
## is not a five-year-plan

---

## You've been on a __ride__. 
## It's time to start __driving__. 

^ You just completed this gigantic difficult undertaking and you have just made a big change in your life, and you feel a little like you are clinging to a cliff face with your very fingertips and you really gotta concentrate on not falling to your death and I want you to PLAN what the hell? 

^ Yes. I do. Because this can start to feel like you are on a roller coaster or a runaway train or a bucking horse or some other metaphor and all your time and effort needs to be spent just on holding on. And the super secret way to take control of that and stop the panic is to....stop panicking and take control of it. This is your new career, and it is entirely in your hands. Especially at a place like Labs, with all it's independence and freedom, it's up to you to decide where you want to go and how you are going to get there. If you don't take that control, you may drift, and end up places you don't want to be.

# Why __five__ years? 

^ Admittedly kind of arbitrary, but it manages to be far enough away that you can dream kind of big, and close enough that it still feels achievable. I feel like I can imagine five years from now. Ten years from now is bonkers far away. I can see how decisions I made five years ago got me where I am now. Ten years ago feels like another country. This isn't a bucket list, I'm not asking you to come up with what you want to achieve before you die. I'm saying, think about how you want the next five years--conveniently, the first five years of your software career, to go.

## What kind of developer do you want to be? 

^ So, the most obvious thing to think about is what you want to be when you grow up. And there's a couple different ways to think about how you build up your career. Absolutely, for the next several months, you should be concentrating on learning more about Swift, about client projects, about being on a team. But this is the five year plan, right? Don't just think about that stuff.

## Pedal wrench 
## __vs__
## Swiss army knife

^ Sometimes I describe the kind of developers we have at labs as a mix of pedal wrenches and Swiss army knives. A pedal wrench is a very specific tool, and you can't use it for much else. It's super good at getting the pedals off your bike. It's also decent as a bludgeoning weapon. But after that, we kind of run out of uses for it. But man, the one thing it is good for, it's the best for. A Swiss army knife on the other hand, is pretty good at a lot of  things. It's not the best there is at any one thing, but it's perfectly good at the things it can do. And honestly, when it's the only wine opener you've got on hand, it'll get you into that bottle of wine, and that's the most important thing.

## The 
# __T__ 
## shaped person

^ I've also heard people talk about T-shaped persons, which is the idea that people should develop deep knowledge of one thing, but also broad and shallow knowledge about a lot of things. This translates really well into a model of a software career, too--build up a line of knowledge in one topic or tech stack or language, but also pick up skills in related areas. 

^ In the end, both of these ideas are metaphors, frameworks for a way of thinking about your career. You don't need to decide right now if you want to specialize or generalize, or what you want your T to be made out of, but you can definitely make deciding those things one of your 5-year goals.

# WAT DO
# ???

^ So what should you be considering when you think about the next couple years? I find setting goals to be really useful, so let's talk about the different kinds of goals you should think about. I cribbed a lot of these from a blog post by Julia Evans about career goals, I'll post a link later today. 

---

# Life goals[^1]
- Get married 
- Have kids 
- Travel a lot 
- Own a home 
- Publish a poem 

[^1]: Julia Evans https://jvns.ca/blog/2018/09/30/some-possible-career-goals/

^ what do you want your life to look like outside of work? what are you working for? what does your job pay for and provide for you? Start thinking about these things, because in a lot of the ways, these are the things you are working FOR. 

--- 

# Technical goals [^2]

- Be comfortable working in large codebases
- Become a core maintainer of an important Open Source project
- Understand how complex systems fail 
- Build prototypes quickly for new ideas 

^ What do you want to do technically? What skills do you want to develop? 

[^2]: Julia Evans https://jvns.ca/blog/2018/09/30/some-possible-career-goals/ 

--- 

# Job goals [^3]
- Get a specific title 
- Work at a nonprofit/for a mission you believe in 
- Start freelancing 
- Build developer tools 
- Work remotely 

[^3]: Julia Evans https://jvns.ca/blog/2018/09/30/some-possible-career-goals/

^ And I'm separating out the job stuff from the technical stuff on purpose. What do you want to achieve at work, specifically. 

--- 

# Community goals [^4]
- Build inclusive teams 
- Mentor someone 
- Give a talk at a conference or meetup 
- Teach a class 

[^4]: Julia Evans https://jvns.ca/blog/2018/09/30/some-possible-career-goals/

^ What about community stuff? Do you want to contribute to the wider dev community, and if so, how and how much? I always support this kind of thing, but it's not for everyone and maybe you don't want to bother yet. 

^ So, think about these different kinds of goals. Set a few from each category for yourself and start working towards them.

# The visioning approach

^ There's another approach to this thing that can help if you are feeling stuck, or feeling overwhelmed by the idea, and that's visioning. I'm new to visioning, so this parts a little fuzzy. But the idea is that you make a clear and detailed vision of where you are and what you are up to, at a point five years in the future. It's right before Halloween, 2023, the former Zeta apprentices are have a reunion breakfast and as you walk in, you are thinking about how far you've come, you've done this and this and that, you are working on x and y, and spoke at this meetup and are a maintainer of that open source repo. 

^ The idea of visioning, as I understand it, is less about setting goals and more about setting a destination and from there, working on your road map to get there. 

--- 

# The __journey__ is the __destination__

^ My dad says this all the time, and he's right. Part of the reason why you should do things like set goals and create five year plans is to take control of your circumstances and making sure you are going where you want to go. But in a lot of ways, it's not the destination or the achieving of those goals that's important. It's process of getting there. If you know where you want to be in five years, you can think about what you need to do this year to get a little closer to that destination. You can look at a bunch of very small decisions in the context of, will this get me closer to where I want to go? Should I grab this card, or volunteer for this task, or go to this conference or whatever. This is going to sound like it's contradicting what I just said, but you really don't want to think of your life as five-year chunks with a checklist of things to accomplish that you robotically move through. You are building a career and a life that is fulfilling, interesting, and challenging in the best ways, and a life isn't made up of goals accomplished, it's made of the experiences you have. 

--- 

# Revisit and Revise 

^ And that's why part of this process is to be continually thoughtful about it. Revisit your goals and your vision periodically. Think about those experiences you are having and whether you are enjoying them. These goals, this vision, this plan is yours and you own it completely. And it's not carved in stone. The point of it is to give you some guidance and help you be thoughtful and purposeful about your career, not to be a hostage situation. If you think you want to be a conference speaker but you do one lightening talk at a meetup and it leaves you in tears and shuddering in the corner...maybe do something else? What if you win the lottery at year 3? What if you take a vacation to Norway, meet a hot Viking, and decide to buy a houseboat in the TromsÃ¸? If you get to year five and your goals or your interests or circumstances have changed, you haven't failed your five-year plan you've just changed. Honestly, it SHOULD change a bit from when you first set it out.

> Go boldly in the direction of your dreams

![](roadahead.jpeg)

^ Remember what I said last week--you are going to walk out of WeWork as apprentices and into Labs as professional developers. You have done something really hard but really incredible, and for some of you, that has involved a change in direction of your life. Like I said earlier, grab the wheel. It's time to start driving into the direction of all the things you want to accomplish. Go forth!
